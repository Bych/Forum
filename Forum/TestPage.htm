                    This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette tape player. She wears it
                    every day. It's not considered vintage — she just likes certain music to sound a
                    certain way. Look at her posture, it's remarkable. That's because she dances. Now
                    he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring, "Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"
